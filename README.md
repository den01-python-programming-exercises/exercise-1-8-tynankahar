# Exercise 1.8 - Conversation

Write a program that works as follows:

```plaintext
Greetings! How are you doing?
*Good thank you!*
Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!
*Well, there's really nothing to tell.*
Thanks for sharing!
```

```plaintext
Greetings! How are you doing?

Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!

The exercise template comes with a program template that includes the function and its call.

```python
